So, it has been a long time coming, but I am sure that once you have experienced the awesome that the Mozilla developers have produced you will agree…. this is a download worth getting!

We have come a long way since I started using Mozilla products. Way back in 2005 when I was a younger boy (what… I’m only 18. I downloaded and rediscovered the web. What did I download? Why I downloaded [Firefox 1.5](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/releases/1.5.html). What a difference and turn that put in the path that is my life.

Since then I have seen the release of the wonderful [Firefox 2.0](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/), [Firefox 3.0](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/3.0/releasenotes/), [Firefox 3.5](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/3.5/releasenotes/), and until recently [Firefox 3.6](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/3.6/releasenotes/). With each new iteration there have been new features, new websites taking advantage of the packed in technologies, and more importantly a better, safer, and more open web.

So why the wait for [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/4.0/releasenotes/)? Does the web not need the love and care it once got from Mozilla? I think that if you respond to that one with a yes then you are misinformed. The wait has not been through lack of caring, quite the opposite! There are now so many new features and capabilities that have been added since 3.6 that it just took a little longer to package them all up for you.

There is more it it than just the new features though... since the beginning Mozilla Firefox has helped grow a global community of dedicated volunteers who are all working towards a common goal. That goal is a better web… it is a never ending mission and as such if you should ever meet one of these people, even if you are one yourself, don’t forget to thank them for their time, effort and dedication, because with out them…. well I hate to think what the web would be like.

Anyhow, that is my boring ramblings... want a full list of features? Visit [www.mozilla.org/firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox)

See [some of the awesome new technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Demos_of_open_web_technologies) packed into the desktop release:

Oh and don’t forget... Firefox is not only for the desktop! Take the web with you with Firefox 4 Mobile!
